My first go at a rails template - completely created for my own needs.

By default it installs Haml, Sass and Compass and Compass is by default configured to use the Blueprint CSS framework.

The user is asked if Authlogic should be included as authentication framework. If the user chooses this, a User and a UserSession model is generated alongside with a UserSessionsController and some helper methods in the ApplicationController.

The user is also asked whether Cucumber is needed. If so Cucumber, Webrat and RSpec will be added in the environments/test.rb and the gems will be installed.

The user can choose to get Capistrano installed and configured as deployment tool - it is pretty much just a default config/deploy.rb that gets generated, and if the user wants to use git for SCM, the git repo is added to the deploy.rb. But keep in mind, that the file probably has to be edited afterwards.

If git is chosen as SCM, there will be generated some sensible default ignore-files, and there will made an initial commit and push to a remote server configured by the user as the very last thing in the template.

Before the commit rails and gems are being frozen into the app.

I have no idea if somebody other than myself can use this template - and I don't know if it can be used without editing the template first. I hope though that I have made the template simple enough and I have scattered enough comments throughout it to make customizations somewhat easy to do.
