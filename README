My first go at a rails template - completely created for my own needs.

It installs Haml, Sass, Compass, Authlogic, Cucumber, Webrat and RSpec. Compass is configured to use the Blueprint CSS framework.

Capistrano is installed and configured if needed.

Furthermore is rails being frozen, and an initial commit to a git repo is performed.

The way git and Capistrano is configured will most likely only work on a server where users and disk layout is organised like on my server.

The template is however pretty simple and understandable and easy to modify to other needs.
